## New features

### VIP and TDM gamemodes
VIP mode turns CTG capture points into VIP escape points and a random person is selected as a VIP.
The VIP's objective is to escape by reaching the objective, while teammates tries to protect them.
The enemy instantly wins the round if the VIP is killed. The VIP has a different player model, stats,
and its own set of available loadouts including exclusive access to the SMAC.

TDM mode turns off both CTG capture points & ghosts, and enables respawning. The round time is extended to 10.25m.

The new convars for these settings are as follows:

* `neo_vote_game_mode` - 1 by default, Vote on game mode to play. TDM=0, CTG=1, VIP=2
* `neo_vip_eligible` - 1 by default, change to 0 to disable chance of being picked as VIP
* `sv_neo_vip_ctg_on_death` - 0 by default, Ghost spawns when VIP dies, continue the game as if it were CTG
* `sv_neo_change_game_type_mid_round` - 1 by default, Allow game type change mid-match
* `neo_tdm_round_timelimit` - 10.25 by default, TDM round timelimit, in minutes
* `neo_ctg_round_timelimit` - 3.25 by default, CTG round timelimit, in minutes
* `neo_vip_round_timelimit` - 3.25 by default, VIP round timelimit, in minutes

### Custom crosshair
You can now easily customize your crosshair. Inside options there is now a new tab called "Crosshair" and from here
you can pick between a textured or custom crosshair.
All crosshair colors can be changed, with the custom crosshair having further settings typical of crosshair customization.
There is also the ability to import and export custom crosshair files (uses the `neoxhr` file extension) for ease of sharing.

The new convars for these settings are as follows:

* `neo_cl_crosshair_style` - 0 by default, Set the crosshair style. 0 = default, 0 to 1 = textured, 2 = custom
* `neo_cl_crosshair_color_[rgba]` - 255 by default, Set the [red/green/blue/alpha] value of the crosshair color - Example: `neo_cl_crosshair_color_r 255`
* Only for custom-style crosshair:
    * `neo_cl_crosshair_size_type` - 0 by default, Set the size unit used for the crosshair. `0 = neo_cl_crosshair_size, 1 = neo_cl_crosshair_size_screen`
    * `neo_cl_crosshair_size` - 15 by default, Set the size of the crosshair
    * `neo_cl_crosshair_size_screen` - 0 by default, Set the size of the crosshair by half-screen scale
    * `neo_cl_crosshair_thickness` - 1 by default, Set the thickness of the crosshair
    * `neo_cl_crosshair_gap` - 5 by default, Set the gap of the crosshair
    * `neo_cl_crosshair_outline` - 0 by default, Set the crosshair outline
    * `neo_cl_crosshair_center_dot` - 0 by default, Set the size of the center dot
    * `neo_cl_crosshair_top_line` - 1 by default, Set if the top line will be shown
    * `neo_cl_crosshair_circle_radius` - 0 by default, Set the circle radius of the crosshair
    * `neo_cl_crosshair_circle_segments` - 30 by default, Set the segments of the circle

### Ready up mechanic
Ready up mechanic is now implemented, disabled by default. Use `neo_sv_readyup_lobby 1` server-side to enable it.
Players can use the `!ready`/`!unready` commands to ready-up, as well as `!overridelimit` to allow for more players
and `!playersnotready` to list players not ready.

The new convars for these settings are as follows:

* `neo_sv_readyup_lobby` - 0 by default, toggles the ready-up feature
* `neo_sv_readyup_teamplayersthres` - 5 by default, the exact amount of players to ready-up and participate to start a game
* `neo_sv_readyup_skipwarmup` - 1 by default, if ready-up feature is on and this is enabled, skip warmup state
* `neo_sv_readyup_autointermission` - 0 by default, if disabled will not automatically enter intermission when the match ends


### Player outlines in spectator mode
Using the `+attack2` keybind (default `x`), can toggle between player outlines/indicators

## Cloaking and visions
