# Neotokyo;Rebuild Development Progress Update

2024-10-14 kinoko and blaberry

Hi, it has been quite a few months since the last dev progress update. Better late than never though, so let’s go over what has happened and where the project is heading!

## What’s the state of NT;RE?

The state of rebuild is looking great. Most of the parity with the current game has been achieved, with some things still needing to be ironed out, and now the devs have started focusing some attention on the post-parity/QoL stuff. To name a few examples - we’re integrating plugin and competitive mode as native server features, clients have custom crosshair support, there's a new menu UI and we’re looking at implementing native gamemodes previously available as sourcemods. Since there has been a lot added over the months, check out the [previous blog entry](/blog/2024-10-13/) for the latest status from our developers.

## How can I try the game?

You can try the game any time! We have a [guide for installing the game](/guide/install).


## Can I contribute?

If you’re familiar with the source engine SDK and mod development or want to help playtest, you’re welcome to join our discord. Message kinoko or blaberry for an invite on the main neotokyo discord.


## I have a feature request!

Open an issue on our github: https://github.com/NeotokyoRebuild/neo/issues. At the moment, we are priotitizing parity with the original NEOTOKYO as it's played right now. Still, if you have wishes for features that may or may not be implemented, you can add them here.

## I heard there was a bounty fund? Can I donate?

Short answer: no, not right now. Long answer: yes, there is a bug bounty fund, it goes towards rewarding our developers. It was created in December 2023 and it’s currently at about 210% liquidity-to-assigned-items. There’s some version of the future where the fund runs dry and opening donations might become a thing. We’ll see.

## Finishing thoughts

If you’re still reading, thanks for your time! It’s been a good ride so far. I’m hoping that we can see the light at the end of the tunnel by next summer, but who knows, we might have something to show before then as well.


To all the developers, playtesters, paperworkers and to the original rights owners who have responded to our questions and requests, THANK YOU! Without all of you, this would never have been possible.
