# Alpha v19.1 Release Note - Mini update
2025-10-06 kinoko

* [Download v19.1-alpha build](https://github.com/NeotokyoRebuild/neo/releases/tag/v19.1-alpha)
* [Install NT;RE (client)](/guide/install/)
* [GitHub Issues (Bug reports and feature requests)](https://github.com/NeotokyoRebuild/neo/issues)

## Gameplay fixes/changes
* Added server commands for enabling overtime in CTG and JGR gamemodes
* Added air friction that only applies to the ghost carrier, VIP and JGR. This should closer mimic the behavior of the anti-ghosthopping plugin used in OGNT than the previous implementation.
* Ghost guns have been banished away (hopefully)

## HUD changes
* Revamped compass - compass now uses proper text fade, each direction label is now drawn separately and the objective now has an actual compass direction instead of using screen space
* Added customization for the compass (done through editing your HudLayout.res file)

## UI changes
* Fixes to the class and weapon selection menus
* Fixes to crosshair related issues
* The amount of bots in a server is now displayed separately to the number of players in the server list
